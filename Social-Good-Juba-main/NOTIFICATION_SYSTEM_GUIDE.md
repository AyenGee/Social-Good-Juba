# üîî Notification System Guide

This guide explains the comprehensive notification system implemented for the Juba platform, which provides real-time notifications for job postings and applications.

## üìã Overview

The notification system automatically notifies users about important events in the platform:

- **Freelancers** receive notifications when new jobs are posted
- **Clients** receive notifications when freelancers apply to their jobs
- **Freelancers** receive notifications when their applications are approved or rejected
- **Both parties** receive notifications when jobs are completed

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend Components

1. **Database Schema** (`setup-notifications-system.sql`)
   - `notifications` table for storing notification data
   - Database triggers for automatic notification creation
   - Functions for notification management

2. **Notification Service** (`server/services/notificationService.js`)
   - Core notification logic
   - Real-time delivery via Socket.IO
   - Integration with existing job and application flows

3. **API Routes** (`server/routes/notifications.js`)
   - REST endpoints for notification management
   - CRUD operations for notifications
   - Unread count tracking

4. **Socket.IO Integration** (`server/index.js`)
   - Real-time notification delivery
   - User-specific notification rooms
   - Connection management

### Frontend Components

1. **Notification Context** (`client/src/context/NotificationContext.js`)
   - Global notification state management
   - Socket.IO client integration
   - Browser notification support

2. **UI Components**
   - `NotificationBell.js` - Notification bell with unread count
   - `NotificationDropdown.js` - Dropdown with recent notifications
   - `NotificationItem.js` - Individual notification display
   - `Notifications.js` - Full notifications page

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Run the SQL migration in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of setup-notifications-system.sql
-- into your Supabase SQL editor and execute
```

### 2. Backend Setup

The notification system is already integrated into the existing routes. No additional setup required.

### 3. Frontend Setup

Install the required dependency:

```bash
cd client
npm install socket.io-client
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Ensure your environment variables are set:

```env
# Server
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id

# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_supabase_database_url
```

## üîî Notification Types

### 1. Job Posted (`job_posted`)
- **Triggered when**: A client posts a new job
- **Recipients**: All approved freelancers
- **Message**: "A new job '[Job Title]' has been posted in [Location]"

### 2. Job Application (`job_application`)
- **Triggered when**: A freelancer applies to a job
- **Recipients**: The job owner (client)
- **Message**: "[Freelancer Email] has applied for your job '[Job Title]'"

### 3. Application Approved (`application_approved`)
- **Triggered when**: A client approves a freelancer's application
- **Recipients**: The freelancer whose application was approved
- **Message**: "Your application for '[Job Title]' has been approved by [Client Email]"

### 4. Application Rejected (`application_rejected`)
- **Triggered when**: A client rejects a freelancer's application
- **Recipients**: The freelancer whose application was rejected
- **Message**: "Your application for '[Job Title]' was not selected this time"

### 5. Job Completed (`job_completed`)
- **Triggered when**: A client marks a job as completed
- **Recipients**: Both the client and the selected freelancer
- **Message**: "The job '[Job Title]' has been marked as completed"

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Job Posting Notifications**
   - Post a job as a client
   - Check that freelancers receive notifications
   - Verify notification content and links

2. **Test Application Notifications**
   - Apply to a job as a freelancer
   - Check that the client receives a notification
   - Verify notification content and links

3. **Test Application Status Notifications**
   - Approve/reject an application as a client
   - Check that the freelancer receives a notification
   - Verify notification content and links

4. **Test Job Completion Notifications**
   - Mark a job as completed as a client
   - Check that both parties receive notifications
   - Verify notification content and links

### Automated Testing

The notification system integrates with existing job and application flows, so existing tests should cover the functionality.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Notifications not appearing**
   - Check Socket.IO connection
   - Verify database triggers are active
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Real-time updates not working**
   - Verify Socket.IO server is running
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure user is in correct notification room

3. **Browser notifications not showing**
   - Check notification permission
   - Verify browser supports notifications
   - Check if notifications are blocked

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'notifications');
```
