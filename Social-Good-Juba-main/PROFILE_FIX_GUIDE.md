# Profile Functionality Fix Guide

## Issues Identified and Fixed

The profile functionality was not working due to several issues:

### 1. Missing Database Fields
The database schema was missing several fields that the Profile component expected:

**Users table missing fields:**
- `first_name` - User's first name
- `last_name` - User's last name  
- `date_of_birth` - User's date of birth
- `gender` - User's gender
- `education_level` - User's education level
- `employment_status` - User's employment status
- `profile_picture_url` - URL for profile picture
- `username` - Unique username for the user

**Freelancer_profiles table missing fields:**
- `languages_spoken` - Array of languages the freelancer speaks
- `transportation_available` - Boolean for transportation availability
- `insurance_coverage` - Boolean for insurance coverage

### 2. Route Conflicts
There were conflicting profile routes in both `/api/users/profile` and `/api/profile` which caused routing issues.

### 3. Server Route Registration
There was a missing space in the profile route registration in the main server file.

### 4. Missing CSS Styles
The Profile component was missing CSS styles for file upload functionality and profile summary display.

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes
1. **`server/index.js`** - Fixed profile route registration
2. **`server/routes/users.js`** - Removed conflicting profile routes
3. **`server/routes/profile.js`** - Already had comprehensive profile functionality
