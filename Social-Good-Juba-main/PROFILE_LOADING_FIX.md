# Profile "Loading Profile..." Fix

## The Issue
The profile page shows "Loading Profile..." forever because the API call is failing.

## Quick Diagnosis

### Step 1: Check if you're logged in
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Type: `localStorage.getItem('token')`
5. If it returns `null`, you need to log in first

### Step 2: Use the Debug Tool
1. Open `http://localhost:3000/debug-profile.html` in your browser
2. Click "Check Auth Status" - this will tell you if you're logged in
3. Click "Test Profile API" - this will test the API call directly

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
1. Go to the Profile page
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Look for error messages like:
   - "Error fetching profile: ..."
   - "HTTP error! status: 401"
   - "HTTP error! status: 403"

### Step 4: Check Network Tab
1. Go to Profile page
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Look for a request to `/api/profile`
5. Check the status code:
   - 401 = Not logged in
   - 403 = Invalid token
   - 500 = Server error

## Solutions

### If you're not logged in:
1. Go to the Login page
2. Sign in with Google
3. Try the Profile page again

### If you get 401/403 errors:
1. Clear your browser data:
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Clear cookies and localStorage
2. Log in again
3. Try the Profile page

### If you get 500 errors:
1. Check the server console for error messages
2. The server might need environment variables set up

### If the API call never happens:
1. Check if the frontend is running on port 3000
2. Check if the backend is running on port 5000
3. Make sure both are running

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Check if server is running
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Check if frontend is running
curl http://localhost:3000
```

## Most Likely Solution

The most common cause is that you're not logged in. Try this:

1. **Log out completely**:
   - Clear browser data (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
   - Or go to `http://localhost:3000` and look for a logout button

2. **Log in again**:
   - Go to the Login page
   - Sign in with Google
   - Make sure you see your user info in the header

3. **Try Profile page**:
   - Click on Profile
   - It should now load properly

## If Nothing Works

1. Open the debug tool: `http://localhost:3000/debug-profile.html`
2. Run all the tests
3. Share the results - this will help identify the exact issue

The profile should work after logging in properly!
